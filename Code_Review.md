On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __5__ based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors

3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines (e.g. it contains extraneous code from the example program that has not been removed) or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:

5  The program produces correct output and is well written and complies with all the Chapman Computer Science Coding Standards

Suggestions for improving the code:

May have been unnecessary to print all the tweets that were searched through, but that was unclear. 
Otherwise, user input was easy to understand. 
Only suggestion would be to add your own notes for sections you work on, but this would probably
be more important in collaborative settings.
